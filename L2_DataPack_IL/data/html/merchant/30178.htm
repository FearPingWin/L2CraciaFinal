<html><body>Trader Zenkin:<br>
Ahh, Welcome! This is the most conscientious shop located at the northern part of Aden.<br>
There is some stupid nonsense going around saying that I, Trader Zenkin, am a wanted man or that I am actually a Timak Orc in disguise! Their $%&*'s ought to be *($#*ed, and their thingies should be $#&*#ed! Don't you think so? Right!?<br>
Anyway, open your eyes widely and look carefully, these aren't normal items are they?!<br>
