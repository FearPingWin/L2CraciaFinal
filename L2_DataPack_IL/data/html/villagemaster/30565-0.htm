<html><body>Flame Lord Kakai:<br>
You, warrior of our race... I shall tell you of the</td></tr> 
Overlord, the high level Shaman of our race, so</td></tr> 
listen carefully! They are those born with the</td></tr> 
fate of ruling over others! Should they become</td></tr> 
lords that lead a clan, the members of that clan</td></tr> 
shall all display remarkable power!</td></tr><br>
Traditionally, we Orcs have chosen the chief of</td></tr> 
a tribe from among the Overlords. In order to</td></tr> 
become an Overlord, a Shaman must pass the</td></tr> 
severe Trial of the Lord. I endured this trial as</td></tr> 
a youngster in order to become the Overlord of</td></tr> 
the Hestui! The lord or chief that you will be</td></tr> 
serving in the future will also have passed this</td></tr> 
trial, so treat them with the reverence and</td></tr> 
honour that they deserve!</td></tr> <br>
