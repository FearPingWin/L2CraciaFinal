The Ketra Orcs grant many privileges to their allies. They may purchase various supplies from Grocer Atan and specialty items from Trader Jumara, and also ask Gatekeeper Kurfa for teleportation service.<br>
If you harm a Ketra Orc while carrying out this mission, your mark of ally will be downgraded one level and the alliance will be broken.
