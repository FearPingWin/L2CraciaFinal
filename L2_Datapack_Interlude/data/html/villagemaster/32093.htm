Head Blacksmith Bolin:<br>
Welcome to the Schuttgart Branch of the Black Anvil Guild. I'm determined to make your visit to Black Anvil Guild a memoralbe experience!<br>
Just think of all the marvelous things we make here! Creation is truly the art of the gods!<br>
Who can deny the supremacy of out race? Who else could even conceive of Siege Golems or the massive weapons we make? Even the mightiest Warriors are powerless without our expertise!<br>
Let me say this again, creativity is infinitely more valuable than swords or magic. Don't you agree?<br>

Head Blacksmith Bolin:
<br>
This cold weather is perfect for forging iron! Hot fire and cold air! What a combination!
<br>
Life is like blacksmithing... Only trials, no matter how troublesome they are can make you strong! Of course, some people can't stand the heat!
