Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>
Hail! I am Alder, Warehouse Chief of the Schuttgart Territory Iron Gate Guild. What a world, eh? Makes you want to pull the covers over you head some mornings.<br>
How can decent folk like us hope to get by? Every day I hear news of rumors of war, sometimes even between kinsmen of the same tribe! It's all madness!<br>
If there's something that gets me through the day, though, it's this: the bottom line is that every tribe wants prosperity. That means engaging in economic activities.<br>
As long as that's the case, we dwarves are indispensible! No one can match our instincts for trade and moneymaking.<br>

Warehouse Chief Alder: <br>
What should the new slogan be this month?  It needs to be a real humdinger! One that will attract lots of new customers... Hmm...  when I looked at your face, suddenly I got a great idea! <br>
"The Adena You Earned While Risking Your Life at the Lair of Antharas. Will You Trust It With Just Anybody?  Take It To The Iron Gate Warehouse! Your Most Reliable Friend, A Friend Indeed In Your Time Of Need!"  <br>
What do you think?  Is that great or what?  What? Too long?  Humph!  What do you know about slogans? <br>
