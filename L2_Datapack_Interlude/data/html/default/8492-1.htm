Rift Post:<br>
There are rules to the <font color="FFFF00">Rift if Dimension</font>. Where you go and what goes on inside there remains a mystery. Once you get inside using the fragment, you'll only be able to stay for <font color="FFFF00">about 40 minutes</font> before <font color="FFFF00">the dimension shifts</font>. Dont forget that.<br>

If you don't like where you entered, you can <font color="FFFF00">move just once</font>.<br>
This decision must be made by <font color="FFFF00">the party leader</font>.<br>

You may not leave the party or allow anyone else to join your party while there, it's too dangerous.<br>
