Blacksmith Pinter:<br>
Now I can get started making Heavy Armor armor. I'll need some D-Grade crystals , but I know better that to ask a lightweight like you to bring them to me!<br>
Have you <font color="LEVEL">Sponsor</font> bring me <font color="LEVEL">922 D-Grade Crystals</font>. Stop whininh! I'm not running a charity here!<br>
Oh, by the way... <font color="LEVEL">You've got to come back with your Sponsor!</font> How else would I know who your sponsor was?
