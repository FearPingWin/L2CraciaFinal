Watchman of the Land Dragon Antharas Gilmore:<br>
So, you're searching for the great heroes? My memory isn't so good as it was in those days.<br>
You should go and find the Elven Witch <font color="LEVEL">Baraham</font>, who was one of the seventeen heroes. She became an evil creature of her own free will. She must be carrying "Legend of Seventen". <br>
Go and retrieve it from her evil grip.
