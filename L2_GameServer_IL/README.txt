1. Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. L2J

L2J is an Alternative Lineage 2 Game Server written in pure Java for
best compatibility. L2J gives you the possibility to legally host a game
server for this popular Korean MMO created by NCSoft. It is still
unfinished and many features are missing, but L2J Dev team is working
hard on implementing them. L2J Server is distributed under the terms
of GNU/GPL in a hope that open source model is the best for
developing quality software giving everyone a possibility to
participate on development by submitting the code.

1.2. L2JFree

L2jFree is a l2j fork founded by evill33t and DaDummy.
We take the great work of l2j and l2jdp and try to improve it to be 
more stable and to be more like retail and offers more options to customize it to
youre needs.
Still we try to keep our sources in sync with latest l2j and l2jdp changes to 
keep the differences small and migrating from one to each other possible 
without or at least with small dataloss. 
L2j-free was the first public l2j project sharing sources that allowed you to 
connect with a C5 client and later Interlude (kr beta).

5. Bug Reporting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs can be reported on our bugtracker:
http://www.l2jfree.com/flyspray/
Basic rules for reporting are:
    Please report only one bug/issue per ticket!!
    You must include the revision (changeset) number when reporting a bug!
    "The latest" does not mean anything when 5 more updates have been done since you set up the server.

Players should ALWAYS consult bugs with their Admin/GM's and have them report it
on our wiki site. Some bugs may be caused by bad datapack, server
installation or modifications server owner has made. We can't help you
in that case.

Please use the datapacks bugtracker for reporting datapack bugs.
Please do NOT report bugs related to unofficial add-ons to L2JFree.
