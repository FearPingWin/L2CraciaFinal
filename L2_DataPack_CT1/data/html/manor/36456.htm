<html><body>I am a trader sent by the Lord to sell the manor's
seeds and purchase indigenous products.<br>
The seeds that I'm selling can be sowed only in
this manor.However, the indigenous products
can be sold to any castle. For a small
commission, I'll sell them on behalf of you to
other manors in other castles.<br>
The sale and purchasing of seed starts from 8
p.m. everyday. Look up information of the manor
posted from 6 a.m., get prepared ahead, and
come back at 8 p.m. Hurry up before the goods are sold out, ha, ha.<br>
If you have any such indigenous products, I will
buy them from you now. The Lord will be
pleased.<br>
Don't be embarrassed if you don't know the
meanings of some of the words I use, such as
"manor" or "indigenous product". All questions
will be answered, you need only ask.<br>
