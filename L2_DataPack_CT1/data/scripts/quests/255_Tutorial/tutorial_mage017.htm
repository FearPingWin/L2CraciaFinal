<center><font color="LEVEL">[Benefits for New Characters]</font></center><br>
A character who has achieved level 6 for the first time among your characters will receive various <font color="LEVEL">benefits for a new character</font> such as additional quest reward. After that, although your other characters achieve level 6 and up, they will not receive the benefits. Therefore, make your choice carefully regarding whether you should continue growing your current character until it attains level 6 so that it can receive benefits as a new character or whether you should give up on the current character and start raising a new character.<br>
