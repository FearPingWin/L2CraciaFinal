<center><font color="LEVEL">[Learning Skills]</font></center><br>
Congratulations! You have reached level 5!<br>
Now you can start to learn new skills. In order to learn a new skill, you need to meet a <font color="LEVEL">Master in a village</font>. If you move in the direction indicated by the arrow above your character's head, you will be able to meet a master.<br>
In order to learn skills, <font color="LEVEL">skill points (SP)</font> are needed. You can accumulate skill points by hunting monsters. If you run out of SP while learning a skill, you can hunt more monsters to earn more SP.<br>
You may check your current skill points (SP) from your <font color="LEVEL">Character Status window</font>. Click the <font color="FF0000">face shaped icon</font> located in the lower right hand side of the screen or press Alt+T to open the Character Status window.<br>

<center><font color="LEVEL">[Benefits for New Characters]</font></center><br>
A character who has achieved level 6 for the first time among your characters will receive various <font color="LEVEL">benefits for a new character</font> such as additional quest reward. After that, although your other characters achieve level 6 and up, they will not receive the benefits. Therefore, make your choice carefully regarding whether you should continue growing your current character until it attains level 6 so that it can receive benefits as a new character or whether you should give up on the current character and start raising a new character.<br>
