Well, the fact is..., <font color="LEVEL">It is necessary to write down the spells to erase the seal. For instance, it is a parchment</font>. 
Please go to wall of Argus, and take a small amount of skin of the antelope. It only has to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope Slave</font>. 
These skins are dressed, it becomes the substitute of the parchment.
