Grand Master Hector:<br>
Welcome! Are you here to test your mettle in Schuttgart?<br>
Few Warriors come out here to test their abilities, and we Grand Masters rarely have opportunity to show off our skills!<br>
If you do well, it just might improve our standing, eh?<br>

Grand Master Hector:<br>
What are you doing there?! Don't be shy! Come on over here! I won't bite you!<br>
You look like a rough-and-ready fighter to me! Yes, Shutgard is definitely a place where top-notch warriors gather.
<br>
Recently I've noticed many talented young people in this place.  I'm very curious about what might happen here next...
