Rift Post:<br>
Welcome to the rift between the dimensions of time and space! Where you're standing now is relatively safe. It was created using all available resources. By the way, I see that inner space where you're looking, and i must warn you... We can't guarantee your safety! Don't try to go there without our help!<br>

Don't forget! You'll have a better chance of returning alive if you take some friends with you. What do you want to do?<br>
