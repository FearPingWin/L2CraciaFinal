Spellbook Seller Raheel:<br>
Pleased to meet you! I'm Raheel. I trade in old books and spellbooks. I've loved books since I was a child... They're a cultural treasure trove! This world would be filled with ignorant savages if there were no books! I don't even want to imagine it!<br>
I heard that countless books were burned during the final days of the empire, under the pretext of rooting out heretics. Just because they disagreed with the ideas in the books, they felt like they had to burn them! If you ask me, they got what was coming to them!
