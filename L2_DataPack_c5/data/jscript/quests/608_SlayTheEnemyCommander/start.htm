So, you say you wanna obtain the totem of wisdom?<br>
Ok, I have one strategic order. Go to the Varka Silenos Stronghold, slay Varka's commander Mos and bring back his head. Then maybe I can help you.<br>
While carrying out the mission, if you attack a Ketra Orc, this mission will be canceled automatically.
