The Varka Silenos Tribe grants many privileges to their allies. They can purchase various supplies from Grocer Diyabu and specialty items from Trader Shikon, and also ask Gatekeeper Teranu Mardui for teleportation service.<br>
If you ever harm a Varka Silenos while carrying out this mission, your mark of ally will be downgraded one level and the alliance will be broken.
