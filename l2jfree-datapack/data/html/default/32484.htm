Hail, adventurer.  Why do you look at me so?  Well, I dare say you wouldn't look any better if you hadn't slept in a week.  I may look a little unkempt and twitchy around the edges.  But better this than the alternative, which is a waking nightmare from which you NEVER return.<br>
Do you have any money?  No, it’s not for liquor!  I'm sleep deprived, you lout.  Not some lush.  I simply need money to ...buy.......more...........coffee.............<br>
